            <h3>Tobias is a friendly consultant who enjoys running</h3>

                <p>
                Tobias Lee is a 27-year-old consultant who enjoys worship, helping old people across the road and spreading
                right-wing propoganda. He is kind and creative, but can also be very lazy and a bit grumpy.

                <p>
                    He is a Rhainish Christian who defines himself as straight. He didn't finish school. He has a severe
                    phobia of butterflies.</p>

                <p>
                    Physically, Toby is not in great shape. He needs to gain quite a lot of weight. He is tall with fair
                    skin, copper hair and brown eyes. He has patches of flesh falling off.</p>

               <p>
                He grew up in a working class neighbourhood. His father left when he was young, leaving him with his
                mother, who was an addict.</p>

               <p>
                He is currently single. His most recent romance was with a stranger called Harmony Pearl Gibson, who was
                the same age as him. They broke up because Harmony felt that Andrew was too lazy to keep up the
                relationship.</p>

                <p>
                    Toby's best friend is a journalist called Hugh Woodward. They are inseparable. He also hangs around with a
                    musician called Woodrow Smith. They enjoy ice skating together.</p>
            </p>

        <div class="quote">

            "I know for certain that we never lose the people we love, not even in death. Toby had left a lasting
            impression in our memories, and we find comfort in knowing that having shared his love has made our lives
            richer."
